# Open iCloud Drive

iCloud Drive is a good solution for cloud storage and file synchronization across devices. The user interface is nice like a native directory in the file system. However, as a cloud drive, opening it every time through the file system is not that straight forward. It would be better to open it and access those files synchronized across devices in one click on Mac.

This app learns the idea from other cloud drive solutions, such as Dropbox and Google Drive. These apps have a shortcut on the menubar to open the folder in one click. I want to provide the same feature to the iCloud Drive.
