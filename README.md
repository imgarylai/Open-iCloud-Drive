# Open iCloud Drive

iCloud Drive is an easy to use cloud storage solution and file synchronization. It is built like a directory in the file system. However, as a cloud drive solution, opening it every time through the file system is not that straight forward.  We some times want to open it to access those files synchronized across devices in one click.

This app learns the idea from other cloud drive solutions, such as Dropbox and Google Drive. These apps have a shortcut on the menubar to open the folder in one click.
